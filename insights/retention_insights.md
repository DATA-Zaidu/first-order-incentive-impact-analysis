**Insight 1 — Baseline retention is critically low**


Customer | Status         |	Customers
Churned  | (1 order only) |	90,557
Retained |(2+ orders)     |	2,801

Retention Rate: ~3%
Churn Rate: ~97%

Insight:

Nearly 97% of customers churn after their first delivered order, indicating an extremely weak baseline retention.

Why this matters:

Revenue is not compounding

Growth depends heavily on continuous re-acquisition

Any acquisition spend is at high risk of not being recovered
