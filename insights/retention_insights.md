1. Baseline customer retention is extremely weak
Retention Breakdown
Customer Status	Customers	Share of Customers
Churned (1 order only)	90,557	~97%
Retained (2+ orders)	2,801	~3%
Key takeaway

Only ~3% of customers return after their first order

~97% churn immediately, indicating almost no organic retention

Why this matters

Sustainable growth requires customer compounding. With such low retention, the business must continuously spend on acquisition just to maintain revenue, making growth fragile and expensive.
