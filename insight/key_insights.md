**Note:** Incentive analysis is scenario-based due to the absence of explicit discount history. Results evaluate behavioral sensitivity, not exact historical attribution.




**1. Baseline customer retention is extremely weak**
Retention Breakdown

| Customer Status       |	Customers	Share of Customers |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Churned (1 order only)|	90,557	~97%                 |
|Retained (2+ orders) 	|2,801	~3%      ~4–7%         |

**Key takeaway**

Only ~3% of customers return after their first order

~97% churn immediately, indicating almost no organic retention

**Why this matters**

Sustainable growth requires customer compounding. With such low retention, the business must continuously spend on acquisition just to maintain revenue, making growth fragile and expensive.

**First-order incentive size does not improve retention**

Retention by Incentive Level (Scenario-Based)

|Incentive Level	      | Customers	Repeat Rate (%)    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
|  Low                  |	23,593	3.08%                |
|  Medium               |	34,850	2.92%                |
|  High	                | 34,915	3.03%                |


**Key takeaway**

Repeat rates remain ~3% across all incentive levels

No meaningful difference between low, medium, or high incentives

**Why this matters**

Increasing first-order discounts does not change customer behavior. Discounts increase acquisition volume, but not customer loyalty.

**3. Higher incentives do not generate higher long-term value**
   
90-Day LTV by Incentive Level

|Incentive Level	      |     90-Day LTV               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
|  Low                  |	        124.77               |
|  Medium               |         124.97               |
|  High	                |       	125.77               |


  
**Key takeaway**

90-day LTV is nearly identical across incentive levels

Higher upfront discounts are not recovered through future purchases

**Why this matters**

Spending more on first-order incentives increases customer acquisition cost without increasing lifetime value, resulting in flat or negative ROI.

---

**4. Retention failure is structural, not promotional**

**Combined Evidence**

Retention ≈ flat across incentive levels

LTV ≈ flat across incentive levels

Majority of customers churn after first order

**Key takeaway**

The churn problem exists after the first purchase

Incentives are not the lever to fix retention

**Why this matters**

Efforts to grow by increasing discounts will not address the core issue. Retention improvements must come from post-purchase experience, not acquisition tactics.
